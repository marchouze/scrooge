# Bea — daily accounting readiness, 2026-06-11

Autonomous run of Bea's daily accounting-readiness attestation per `Team/Bea.md` operating spec § 6 (Cadence). Run by the agent runtime; no human-in-the-loop. Eleventh handler in the fleet-rollout sequence under `D-FLEET-ROLLOUT-SEQUENCING`. Closes the engineer-side of Camille's CFO-line measurement-substrate gap.

**Headline:** 5 accounting cycles tracked · engineer readiness 0 ready / 0 drafting / 4 specified / 1 not-yet-specified · 1 Bea-owned obligation on register (0 IN FORCE) · 0 accounting events (last 7d).

## Camille's latest snapshot

Latest `FinancialPositionSnapshot` event: 2026-06-08T06:41:04.308Z

Bea's daily run pairs with Camille's weekly run: Camille reports the CFO-line readiness side; Bea reports the engineer side. Together they close the read-side ↔ build-side loop on the close / BA-return / AFS substrate.

## Engineer-side readiness by cycle

| Cycle | Camille observes | Engineer-side state | Substrate required | Next engineering step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly close | never — substrate gap | specified | Sub-ledger projection over postable events + close-cycle orchestrator + IFRS classification engine. Owner: Bea joint with Atlas. | Specify chart-of-accounts schema; publish first posting rule (synthetic FundingDrawn → debit cash / credit funding-liability) per IFRS 9 + IAS 1; wire CloseApproved producer. |
| Quarterly BA return | never — substrate gap | specified | BA-return generator (BA 600 / 200 / 300 / 700) — cell-level mapping from sub-ledger + RWA + obligations register. Owner: Bea joint with Anya. | Draft BA 600 cell-map register against synthetic capital line per Banks Act Reg 38; commission Anya's BA-return projection harness; first dry-run BAReturnGenerated when sub-ledger projection lands. |
| Annual AFS | never — substrate gap | specified | Statutory AFS line-item generator + IFRS 7 disclosure pack + auditor working-paper generator. Owner: Bea. | Defer AFS engine until first close lands; specify line-item schema (IAS 1 structure) so the generator can be drafted in parallel with Bea's close engine. |
| Capital-plan refresh | never — substrate gap | specified | Capital-base projection — CET1 numerator + RWA denominator + Pillar 2A + buffers. Owner: Bea joint with Rohan; consumed by Camille + Eitan. | Specify capital-base derivation per Banks Act Reg 38 (mirrors Rohan's CET1-buffer line); build against the synthetic capital line in seeds; CapitalPlanRefreshed wired to Camille's weekly snapshot. |
| IFRS 9 ECL staging cycle | n/a — no exposure book in build phase | not-yet-specified | ECL staging engine — three-stage IFRS 9 classification + lifetime/12-month PD × LGD × EAD + overlay register. Owner: Bea co-owned with Rohan; methodology approved by Helena, accounting policy approved by Camille. | Defer until first credit exposure (Saskia's first counterparty / Niko activation). Methodology spec stays drafted in parallel so it can be wired the day the first exposure books. |

## Bea-owned obligations on register

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| IN FORCE | 0 |
| PARTIAL | 0 |
| PLANNED | 1 |
| DRAFTING | 0 |
| N/A-yet | 0 |
| **Total** | **1** |

_Source: rows in `Regulations/_obligations-register.md` whose Owner column names Bea (typically as the engineer behind a Camille-owned IFRS / BA-return entry). Coarse — refines once the register exposes a structured per-row API._

## Accounting-domain events (last 7 days)

| Event | Count |
|---|---|
| `IFRSClassificationAssigned` | 0 |
| `ECLBookingApproved` | 0 |
| `SubLedgerEntryPosted` | 0 |
| `RestatementProposed` | 0 |
| `MaterialIFRSClassificationChange` | 0 |

_Build-phase posture: zero accounting-domain events. The bank has no real bookings, no real positions, no real revenue (per CLAUDE.md build-phase vs licence-day). The posting pipeline activates when Atlas's first postable producer ships and synthetic transactions begin flowing through the sub-ledger projection._

## Substrate gaps surfaced this run

- **Sub-ledger projection (Bea + Atlas)** — close-cycle pipeline. `CloseApproved` event-type registered on Camille's snapshot but no producer. Required pre-first-close.
- **Posting-rule register (Bea + Atlas)** — no posting rules published yet; first rule (e.g., `FundingDrawn` → debit cash / credit funding-liability) gates the first sub-ledger entry.
- **Chart-of-accounts schema (Bea)** — chart not yet authored as a typed register; required input for posting-rule publication.
- **BA-return generator (Bea + Anya)** — BA 600 / 200 / 300 / 700 cell-map register drafted but not wired to projections. Required pre-first quarterly BA submission.
- **IFRS engine (Bea)** — IFRS 9 staging logic prototyped; IFRS 13 FV-hierarchy classification prototyped; IFRS 15 / 16 not yet started. Required pre-licence.
- **Capital-base projection (Bea + Rohan)** — pre-condition for `CapitalPlanRefreshed` cycle and Rohan's CET1-buffer measurement.
- **Auditor working-paper generator (Bea)** — designed; not yet built. Required pre-first-audit.
- **XBRL pack builder (Bea)** — gated on first audited reporting cycle; defer to post-licence.
- **ECL staging engine (Bea + Rohan)** — defer until first credit exposure books; methodology spec stays drafted in parallel.

## Provenance

Camille's latest `FinancialPositionSnapshot` via `eventStore.replay({type:"FinancialPositionSnapshot"})` (max as_of); engineer-side readiness map curated by Bea against `Team/Bea.md` § 16 (substrate gaps); Bea-owned obligation counts parsed from `Regulations/_obligations-register.md` (rows where Bea appears in any cell); event counts via `eventStore.replay({type:...})` filtered to last 7 days.
